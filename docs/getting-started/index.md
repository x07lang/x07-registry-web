# Getting started (x07.io)

`x07-registry-web` is the UI for the X07 package registry at https://x07.io/.

For the canonical package workflow (how to add, lock, pack, and publish packages), follow the x07lang.org docs:

- Packages overview: https://x07lang.org/docs/packages/
- Publishing by example: https://x07lang.org/docs/packages/publishing-by-example/

## What the UI is for

- Search/browse package names and available versions.
- Inspect package metadata and module IDs.
- Link out to the registry API contract and index endpoints.

## UI guides

- [Search packages](search-packages.md)
- [Install a package (toolchain)](install-package.md)
- [Publish a package (toolchain)](publish-package.md)

## Local development

See `README.md` for how to run the dev server and build the static site.
